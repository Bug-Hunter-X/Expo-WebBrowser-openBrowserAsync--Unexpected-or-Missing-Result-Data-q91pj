# Expo WebBrowser.openBrowserAsync Unexpected Result Bug

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Expo's `WebBrowser.openBrowserAsync` function.  Under certain conditions (e.g., specific browser configurations, network issues, or Expo versions), the function may complete without throwing an error but return an unexpected or incomplete result object. This can lead to silent failures and difficult-to-debug issues in your application.

## Bug Description
The `WebBrowser.openBrowserAsync` function is expected to return a result object containing information about the browser operation. However, in some cases, the result object may be `undefined`, `null`, or contain unexpected properties or missing keys (like `type` or `url`).  This makes it challenging to reliably handle cases where the browser interaction fails or is interrupted.

## Reproduction
The `bug.js` file demonstrates the problematic behavior. Run this code and observe the console output. You may need to adjust the URL or test under different conditions to reliably reproduce the bug.
